      <h1>WELCOME TO OUR GYM</h1>
      <p>Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) is a full-contact discipline incorporating all combat sports and martial arts with a focus on wrestling, Judo, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Muay Thai, and boxing. Other prominent components are Karate, Tae Kwon Do, and traditional kickboxing. The rules allow for striking and grappling from a standing position or from the ground. Victory in MMA is gained through knock-out or submission by an opponent.</p>

      <p>The Element MMA program prepares our MMA students for competition with skills and techniques from a variety of disciplines. With a focus on careful conditioning, strength training, endurance, mental preparedness, and resilience, our specialized training team guides students to develop skills in a multitude of fighting styles. Our studio offers students aged 8 and up who are interested in mastering MMA the ability to train in classes or with one-on-one personalized coaching</p>
      <p>
        The benefits of studying MMA are undeniable. Cross-training alone will change your body and improve your health. You will notice increased strength, toning, endurance, cardiovascular conditioning, balance, speed, and more. But MMA is seen as “kick-butt” for a reason. MMA will foster a power, spirit, drive within you that will permeate your entire life. You will have a newfound confidence in your mental, spiritual, and physical ability.

Our MMA program is an open class for all ages over 7. Our curriculum blends fundamental components of boxing, Muay Thai, grappling, Jiu-Jitsu, Judo, and wrestling to foster well-rounded competencies similar to that commonly seen in the UFC. Students learn standing strikes as well as grabs, throws, and ground techniques. Our studio has an MMA cage simulator, a half cage where we practice the art.
We encourage our students to cross-train in all disciplines and participate in MMA programming to understand the art of combining the best of each martial art.
